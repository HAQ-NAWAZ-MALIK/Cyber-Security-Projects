## Description
This KeyLogger program captures keystrokes, system information, clipboard data, audio from the microphone, screenshots, and webcam snapshots. It also encrypts sensitive data for security purposes.

## Features
- Keylogging functionality to capture keystrokes
- System information collection
- Clipboard data copying
- Audio recording from the microphone
- Screenshots and webcam snapshots capture
- Email functionality to send captured data
- Data encryption for security

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Libraries: email, smtplib, socket, platform, win32clipboard, pynput, time, os, scipy, sounddevice, cryptography, requests, cv2, PIL

## Setup Instructions
1. Install Python 3.x.
2. Install required libraries using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Generate an encryption key using the Cryptography folder.
4. Configure email settings in the script (`email`, `password`, `recipient_email`).
5. Set the file path for saving files (`file_path`).
6. Run the script.

## Usage
